// request for all orders
// sort the orders

// for each order, get the orderItems for each
// sort the order items by longest prep time first

// create a listing of the order items inside each order
// (draw a div for each order, and inside of it put
// 		a div for each orderItem)

// set a click handler to change the orderItem's status to:
// prep, if it's waiting
// ready, if it's in prep

// if all the orderItems in an order are ready, then remove the order from the screen
// but if only some are, display the "ready" ones a different color or something

// maybe color-code orders or alternate?
